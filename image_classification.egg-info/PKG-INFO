#  image-classification on swift ios

To find wheater a potato has a disease of  not by looking at the potato

this repository is build using uv. 





## Data collection

we are using a kaggle data set https://huggingface.co/datasets/Nattakarn/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition

1. Preprocess the image data using Keras
2. Visualize the data using Matplotlib
3. Split the dataset into train, validation and test sets
4. Shuffle and prefetch for performance
5. Image Augmentation


## convolutional neural network
1. build and train the model
2. evaluate the model and get the accuracy and loss
3. Make a graph of the accuracy and loss
4. save the model


## run the model
1. run the model using the tf.serving and fastapi
2. create a /predict endpoint to predict the image that take the image data as an imput and returns the prediction
3. 

## deploy the model on the 
1. deploy the model in the aws sagemaker
